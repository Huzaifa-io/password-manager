# Password Manager

A simple, client-side password manager built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This web application allows users to securely store, view, edit, and delete website passwords. It utilizes `localStorage` to store the passwords in the browser, and `SweetAlert2` for enhanced user interaction.

## Features

- **Login**: Protected by a simple password (the default password is "login").
- **Password Storage**: Save, edit, and delete passwords associated with websites.
- **Password Visibility Toggle**: Show or hide stored passwords.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile and desktop devices.
- **Offline Support**: Optional Service Worker for offline functionality (may need additional setup).
- **SweetAlert2**: Used for modal popups for adding and editing passwords.
